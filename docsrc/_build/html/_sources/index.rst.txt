Welcome to the OpenQuake Vulnerability Modeller's Toolkit's documentation!
###########################################################################

The OpenQuake Vulnerability Modellers Toolkit (``oq-vmtk``) is an open source
library that provides an OpenSeesPy-based environment for modelling idealised
building class models such as single (SDOF) and multi-degree-of-freedom
(MDOF) systems and to carry out analysis via linear, nonlinear static, and nonlinear
dynamic approaches for regional vulnerability and risk assessment applications.
The vulnerability toolkit is developed by the Risk Team at the Global Earthquake
Model (GEM) Foundation. Contributions from external users are very welcome!

The ``oq-vmtk`` code is hosted on GitHub at the following link:
https://github.com/GEMScienceTools/oq-vmtk.

Currently, the ``oq-vmtk`` includes the following sub-modules:

- **Intensity Measure Calculator (im_calculator)**: Contains code used for
  processing spectra and intensity measure types from ground-motion records.
- **Intensity Measure Selection (im_selection)**: Contains code for evaluating and
  comparing intensity measures using information-theoretic sufficiency metrics.
- **Model Calibration (calibration)**: Contains code used for calibrating MDOF models
  based on SDOF low-level parameters.
- **Model Building and Analysis (modeller)**: Contains code used to compile SDOF and
  MDOF models in OpenSeesPy and run distinct analyses such as linear (i.e., modal
  analysis), nonlinear static (e.g., static pushovers), and nonlinear time-history
  analyses.
- **Postprocessing (postprocessor)**: Contains code for postprocessing cloud and
  multiple stripe analyses to derive fragility and vulnerability models.
- **Storey Loss Function Generator (slf_generator)**: Contains code for generating
  storey loss functions for a more refined loss assessment of building components.
- **Visualisation (plotter)**: Contains code for visualizing and graphically
  interpreting ``oq-vmtk`` outputs.
