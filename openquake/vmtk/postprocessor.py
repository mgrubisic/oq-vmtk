        lower_limit : float
            The minimum value of EDP below which cloud records are excluded. This is typically set to a small value,
            such as 0.1 times the yield capacity, to avoid records with no damage.

        censored_limit : float
            The maximum value of EDP above which cloud records are excluded. This is typically set to a value like
            1.5 times the ultimate capacity to filter out records corresponding to collapse.

        sigma_build2build : float, optional, default=0.3
            The building-to-building variability or modeling uncertainty. This represents the variation in response
            from one building to another, and is used to model uncertainty in the fragility function.

        intensities : array, optional, default=np.geomspace(0.05, 10.0, 50)
            An array of intensity measure levels used to sample and evaluate the fragility functions. By default,
            this is set to a logarithmic space between 0.05 and 10.0 with 50 points.

        cloud_method : str, optional, default='MLE'
            The method used to fit the cloud regression. Options include:
            - 'mle': Maximum likelihood estimation (default).
            - 'lse': Least square error

        fragility_rotation : bool, optional, default=False
            A boolean flag to indicate whether or not the fragility function should be rotated about a target percentile.
            If set to `True`, the function will rotate the fragility curve to match the given percentile.

        rotation_percentile : float, optional, default=0.1
            The target percentile (between 0 and 1) around which the fragility function will be rotated, if
            `fragility_rotation` is `True`. For example, a value of 0.1 means a rotation to the 10th percentile.

        fragility_method : str, optional, default='probit'
            The method used to fit the fragility function. Options include:
            - 'probit': Probit regression model (default).
            - 'logit': Logit regression model.
            - 'ordinal': Ordinal regression model.
            - 'lognormal': Lognormal distribution model for the fragility function.

        Returns:
        --------
        cloud_dict : dict
            A dictionary containing the outputs of the cloud analysis, which includes:
            - 'cloud inputs': Input data used in the analysis (IMLs, EDPs, thresholds, limits).
            - 'fragility functions': Results of the fragility function fitting, including predicted exceedance probabilities (poes),
              fragility method used, and related parameters.
            - 'regression coefficients': Fitted regression coefficients (b1, b0), sigma values, and fitted data for the model.

        """
        Perform maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for fragility curve fitting following a multiple stripe analysis.
        This method calculates the fragility function by fitting to the provided intensity measure levels (IMLs)
        and engineering demand parameters (EDPs) "stripes", with the option to rotate the fragility curve around
        a target percentile.

        The method is useful for deriving fragility functions by determining the probability
        of exceedance for various damage states based on the provided data.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        imls : list or array
            A list or array of intensity measure levels (IMLs) representing the seismic intensity levels used for
            sampling the fragility functions.

        edps : list or array
            A list or array of engineering demand parameters (EDPs), which describe the structural response to
            seismic events. Examples include maximum interstorey drifts, maximum peak floor acceleration, or top
            displacements.

        damage_thresholds : list
            A list of EDP-based damage thresholds that correspond to different levels of structural damage, such
            as slight, moderate, extensive, and complete. These thresholds help categorize the severity of damage
            based on EDP values.

        sigma_build2build : float, optional, default=0.3
            The building-to-building variability or modeling uncertainty. It accounts for differences in performance
            between buildings with similar characteristics due to random variations or model uncertainties.

        intensities : array, optional, default=np.geomspace(0.05, 10.0, 50)
            An array of intensity measure levels over which the fragility function will be sampled. By default,
            this is a logarithmic space ranging from 0.05 to 10.0, with 50 sample points.

        fragility_rotation : bool, optional, default=False
            A boolean flag that determines whether or not to rotate the fragility curve about a given percentile.
            If `True`, the fragility curve will be adjusted based on the specified `rotation_percentile`.

        rotation_percentile : float, optional, default=0.10
            The target percentile (between 0 and 1) around which the fragility function will be rotated. A value of
            0.10 corresponds to rotating the curve to the 10th percentile.

        Returns:
        --------
        msa_dict : dict
            A dictionary containing the results of the multiple stripe analysis, including:
            - 'medians': The estimated medians of the fragility function.
            - 'dispersions': The estimated dispersions (variability) associated with the fragility function.
            - 'poes': The probabilities of exceedance (damage probabilities) for different damage states.

        Notes:
        ------
        This method fits the fragility curve using MLE, which minimizes the difference between observed and predicted
        exceedance probabilities. The option for fragility curve rotation allows for adjusting the curve to better
        match the expected percentile of damage occurrence, offering greater flexibility in representing the fragility
        of the structure.

        Perform fragility function fitting and statistical processing on Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA) results.

        This method processes raw IDA data by interpolating individual record response curves to a continuous
        Engineering Demand Parameter (EDP) range. It accounts for "flatlining" (global dynamic instability)
        using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for censored data to estimate the fragility parameters
        (median and dispersion) for multiple damage states. It also supports fragility curve rotation
        around a target percentile to account for modeling uncertainties.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ansys_dict : dict
            A dictionary containing the structural response data. Must include:
            - 'max_peak_drift_list' or 'max_peak_accel_list': A list where each entry is a dictionary mapping
              Scale Factors (SF) to the resulting peak drift or acceleration values.
            - 'sf_matrix': A 2D numpy array (n_records x max_runs) containing the
              scale factors used for each analysis run.

        im_matrix : numpy.ndarray
            A 2D array of intensity measure levels corresponding to the ground motion records and
            number of runs carried out in IDA

        damage_thresholds : list of float
            A list of EDP-based damage thresholds (e.g., interstorey drift ratios) defining
            different limit states (e.g., Slight, Moderate, Extensive, Collapse).

        edp_key : str, optional, default='max_peak_drift_list' (other option is "max_peak_accel_list")
            The key in `ansys_dict` used to retrieve the engineering demand parameter data.

        sigma_build2build : float, optional, default=0.3
            The modeling uncertainty or building-to-building variability. This is combined
            with the record-to-record variability to calculate total fragility dispersion.

        intensities : numpy.ndarray, optional, default=np.geomspace(0.05, 10.0, 50)
            The array of intensity measure levels over which the final fragility functions (POEs)
            will be sampled.

        edp_range: numpy.ndarray, optional, default = np.linspace(0.00, 0.05, 101) (i.e., 0% to 5% drift)
            The array of engineering demand parameters over which the IDA curves will be evaluated

        fragility_rotation : bool, optional, default=False
            Flag to determine if the fragility curves should be rotated around a specific
            percentile to adjust for modeling bias or target reliability levels.

        rotation_percentile : float, optional, default=0.10
            The target percentile (0.0 to 1.0) around which the fragility curve rotation is
            anchored if `fragility_rotation` is True.

        Returns
        -------
        ida_dict : dict
            A nested dictionary containing the analysis results:
            - 'ida_inputs': Metadata including target EDPs and raw interpolated curves.
            - 'fragility': Medians, dispersions (record-to-record and total), and Probabilities
              of Exceedance (POEs).
            - 'stats': Statistical IDA curves including the 16th, 50th (median), and 84th
              intensity percentiles across the EDP range.

        Notes
        -----
        The method uses a log-likelihood minimization approach to handle records that do not
        reach a specific damage threshold within the analyzed range (right-censored data),
        ensuring the fragility curves remain statistically robust even near collapse.

        Calculate the uncertainty in the loss estimates based on the method proposed in Silva (2019),
        which incorporates the sigma (standard deviation) for loss ratios within seismic vulnerability functions.

        This method computes the sigma loss ratio for expected loss ratios and also estimates the parameters
        of a beta distribution (coefficients a and b), which describe the uncertainty and variability in
        the loss estimates. The formula used is derived from seismic vulnerability research.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        loss : list or array
            A list or array of expected loss ratios. The expected loss ratio represents the proportion of
            the building's value that is expected to be lost due to an earthquake event, ranging from 0 to 1.

        Returns:
        --------
        sigma_loss_ratio : list or array
            The calculated uncertainty (sigma) associated with the mean loss ratio for each input loss value.
            The sigma loss ratio represents the variability of the loss estimates and is computed based on the
            loss ratios provided.

        a_beta_dist : list or array
            The coefficient 'a' of the beta distribution for each loss ratio. This parameter represents the shape
            of the beta distribution and is used to model the uncertainty in the loss estimates.

        b_beta_dist : list or array
            The coefficient 'b' of the beta distribution for each loss ratio. This parameter also represents the
            shape of the beta distribution, complementing the coefficient 'a' to fully describe the distribution's
            behavior.
